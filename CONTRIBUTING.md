# Contributing

## Getting started

### Submitting a pull request

If you'd like to contribute by fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or even correcting typos in our documentation, you'll want to submit a pull request. Before submitting a pull request, be sure to [rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) your branch from master. Do not use ``git merge`` or the *merge* button provided by GitHub.

### Merging a pull request

If you are merging a pull request, be sure to use the pull request title as the commit title. The title should follow the [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). It is recommended that if you are merging in pull requests regularly that you add a browser extension that will auto-correct the title for you. A few that should do this are [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) and [Squashed Merge Message](https://github.com/zachwhaley/squashed-merge-message).

## Contribution policy

A “Contribution” is work voluntarily submitted to a project. This submitted work can include code, documentation, design, answering questions, or submitting and triaging issues.

## Guiding principle

Owners, collaborators and contributors work in concert with one another on behalf of the community and prioritize the communities interests over their own.

The development, release, and work management processes must reflect this principle. Accepting contributions to the project requires a review by collaborators.

## Governance

### Owners

*Owners* have admin access and are responsible for the management, maintenance, and operations of the repository.

### Collaborators

*Collaborators* have write access and have an active and sustained impact on the project and participate in triaging issues, reviewing code, mentoring, and working to improve the architectural quality.

### Contributors

*Contributors* have read access and can be anyone who has contributed a completed pull request to the project.

## Acceptance and consensus seeking process

Acceptance of contributions follows the consensus-seeking process.

All pull requests must be approved by a *collaborator* before the pull request can be accepted.

Before a pull request is accepted, time should be given to receive input from *collaborators* or *owners* with the expertise to evaluate the changes. The amount of time can vary but at least 3 days during the typical working week and 5 days over weekends should be given to account for international time differences and work schedules.

When a pull request : (a) has a significant impact on the project, (b) is inherently controversial, or (c) has not reached consensus with *collaborators*; add a "controversial" label to the pull request for the *owners* to review the pull request. Pull requests labeled with "controversial" are not approved until the *owners* reviews the issue and makes a decision.

Specific *collaborators* or *code owners*  can be added to a pull request by including their user alias.

## Stability policy

An essential consideration in every pull request is its impact on the system. To manage impacts, we work collectively to ensure that we do not introduce unnecessary breaking changes, performance or functional regressions, or negative impacts on usability for users or supported partners.
